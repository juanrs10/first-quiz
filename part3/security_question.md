Potential areas of concern:

1. Injection
Attackers might try to inject malicious code into the system, since MySQL database is being use it is vulnerable to SQL injections.

Solution
Usage of parameterized queries and prepared statements in FastAPI when interacting with the database.

2. Broken Authentication
Incorrect implementation of authentication mechanisms might allow unauthorized access.

Solution
-Implement Multi Factor Authentication for employees and customers.
-Ensure password policies that enforce complexity.

3. Sensitive Data
Customer data like passwords, addresses, phone number, etc must be protected both in transit and at rest.

Solution
-Encryption of sensitive data in the database (bcrypt can be used for password hashing).
-Use HTTPS with strong ciphers.

4. XML External Entities
Risk of any XML processing ocurring.

Solution
-Disable XML external entity processing in parsers.
-Avoid serialization of sensitive data.

5. Wrong Access Control
Unauthorized users could access or modify data.

Solution
-Implement Role-Based Access Control.
-Ensure software engineers, customer support, and sales personnel only have the minimum necessary access.
-Regularly review and audit permissions.

6. Security Misconfiguration

Solution
-Regularly review AWS, Kubernets and FastAPI configuration.
-Ensure error messages are generic and don't expose system internals.

7. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Is possible to inject malicious scripts into the web frontend.

Slution
-Clear inputs in NextJS application.
-Ensure the Content Security Policy (CSP) header is set and restricts the sources of scripts.
Use output escaping.

8. Insecure Deserialization

Malicious object creation/data tampering due to insecure deserialization.

Solution
-implement integrity checks and use safe serialization libraries.


9. Using Components with Vulnerabilities
Libraries or modules with known vulnerabilities might be used in any of the components.

Solution

-Regularly update all dependencies: FastAPI, Next.js, MySQL..
-Look up for vulnerability disclosures related to the stack implemented.

10. Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

Attacks being undetected due to insufficient logging/monitoring.

Solution
-Implement logging integrated with infrastructure.
-Monitor logs for suspicious activity.
-Use alerts for suspicious events.
-Store logs securely.

Other recommendations:

-Keep training employees on security best practices.
-Regularly back up data and test recovery procedures.
-Implement physical security barriers.
-Perform security audits in a regular basis.
